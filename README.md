In this project you will find a modified version of Siglentâ„¢ Python3.4 PGM to send commads to Oscilloscopes via LAN port.

Tipicaly using a Raspberry PI you can remotely take control of your Siglent Scope and receive data and/or screenshots directly wherever you are.

you can find two typical examples;

- LAN_Command.py to send single or ripetitive commands to scope

- LAN_Capture.py to get a print screen of the scope display

Enjoy!
